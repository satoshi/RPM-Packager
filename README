RPM-Packager

Building RPMs should be easy.

This is a manifest approach to easily create custom RPMs.  Once this module is installed, building RPMs should be as
simple as writing a YAML file that looks like the following:

    ---
    name: testpackage
    version: grep Changelog             # version string or some command to retrieve it
    os: el6
    dependencies:
      - perl-YAML > 0.5
      - perl-JSON
    files:
      bin: /usr/local/bin               # directory-based mapping.  RPM will install CWD/bin/* to /usr/local/bin.
    user: apache                        # specify the owner of files.  default: root
    group: apache                       # specify the group owner of files.  default: root
    sign:                               # optionally, gpg signing of RPM
      gpg_name: ED16CAB                 # provide the GPG key ID
      passphrase_cmd: cat secret_file   # command to retrieve the secret

Then run:

    rpm_packager.pl <path_to_manifest.yml>

Note : You need to have fpm available in PATH.  For GPG signing, you need to have proper keys imported.
Note2: The 'iteration' field of RPM will be determined by the BUILD_NUMBER env variable plus 'os' field, like '150.el7'.
If BUILD_NUMBER is unavailable, 1 will be used.

You may also interact with the library directly as long as you pass in the manifest information in a hash:

    use RPM::Packager;

    my %args = (
        name    => 'testpackage',
        version => 'grep Changelog',
        files   => { bin => '/usr/local/bin' },
        dependencies => [
            'perl-YAML > 0.5',
            'perl-JSON'
        ],
        os      => 'el6',
        user    => 'apache',
        group   => 'apache',
        sign    => {
            'gpg_name' => 'ED16CAB',
            'passphrase_cmd' => 'cat secret_file'
        }
    );

    my $obj = RPM::Packager->new(%args);
    $obj->create_rpm();                           # RPM produced in CWD
